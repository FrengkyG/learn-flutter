#### Day 1 - *03 June 2022*

#####  What i learn today :
- Create flutter project using terminal
- Get package using terminal
- Basic dart : function, variable, objects, constructor, named constructor, list
- How flutter running or built from main.dart
- Visible and Invisible Widget

##### My Thoughts :
I thought this course would live up to my expectations. I bought this course to learn the concepts of flutter and widgets. Because I don't want to build an app without knowing how the app runs. What I learned before, was learning how to make an app by following the instructions and not knowing how it works
