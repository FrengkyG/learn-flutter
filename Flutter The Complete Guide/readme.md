#### Day 1 - *03 June 2022*
#

#####  What i learn today :
- Create flutter project using terminal
- Get package using terminal
- Basic dart : function, variable, objects, constructor, named constructor, list
- How flutter running or built from main.dart
- Visible and Invisible Widget

##### My Thoughts :
I thought this course would live up to my expectations. I bought this course to learn the concepts of flutter and widgets. Because I don't want to build an app without knowing how the app runs. What I learned before, was learning how to make an app by following the instructions and not knowing how it works

#### Day 2 - *04 June 2022*
#

#####  What i learn today :
- Lists
- Anonymous Function
- Stateless & Stateful widget
- Private properties
- Custom widget
- Enums
- Basic Styling
- Map
- final & const
- if else
- Big Widget vs Small Widgets
- Migrating from old button to new button
- Debugging using print, debug mode vs code, dart dev tools

##### My Thoughts :
I learned a lot about basic widgets and darts. Especially about stateless and stateful widget. I already know state is very important in flutter, so today I am grateful to learn about that. Debugging using vscode is something new for me and i'm happy with this course section because a lot of information I can see using vscode debugging. Lastly, I'm a little bit overwhelmed in dividing the widget into custom widgets and how the data is passed through the constructor. I hope I can understand more in custom widgets
